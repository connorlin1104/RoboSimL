// fetch a robot it has to know the robot is there. The catalog inside the build only ever knows
// about robots that existed when it was compiled, which is exactly the constraint the whole exercise

// ONE INDEX PER ADDRESS, and that is a privacy decision rather than a filing one. A single
// world-readable index naming every robot would hand over the display names, team labels and the
// bare fact that a given team has submitted anything — for robots whose whole point is that they are
// private. So the public index lists public robots, and a private robot is listed only inside the
// folder derived from its own owner code. A device asks the addresses it can compute: the public
// one, plus one per code the player holds. Everything else is unnameable.
//
// FAILURE IS SILENT, on purpose. This runs at launch alongside the inbox fetch. Being offline, being
// on a plane, a bucket that isn't configured, a 404 because nothing has ever been published — none
// of those are the player's problem and none of them should produce a message on a home screen. What
// is NOT silent is a robot that appears in the list and then can't be loaded; that is reported at
// the point the player asks for it, by RobotBundleService.
