// Drives the home screen UI: a main panel (Drive / Settings) and a settings panel where the
// player picks a robot model from the RobotModelCatalog.
//
// The model list is built at runtime by cloning an inactive template Button per catalog entry,
// so adding a model to the catalog asset needs no scene edit. The selection is persisted via
// RobotModelCatalog.SelectedModelId (PlayerPrefs-backed) and shown by tinting the selected
// entry's button image with the accent color.
//
// Usage: the Tools > RoboSim > Scenes > Build Home Screen tool creates the HomeScene, adds this component,
// and wires all references + button onClicks. Drive loads SampleScene.
