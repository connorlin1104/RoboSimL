// Headless validation of the field-interaction features, without entering play mode (modeled on
// RobotPhysicsValidation): edit-mode scripted physics (Physics.simulationMode = Script + Physics.Simulate)
// runs four checks in the saved field scene:
//   - Magnet hit:  a cup dropped slightly off a goal's stack axis gets captured, centered, upright.
//   - Magnet hold: a lateral bump on the seated cup self-corrects (it stays seated and centered).
//   - Magnet miss: a cup dropped clearly off-axis is NOT captured (no teleport-in on a miss).
//   - Roller latch: on the North roller — it holds a face (teleported 30 deg off, it comes back),
//                   it catches a spin (15 rad/s is stopped on a face inside a budget of travel), a
//                   robot-mass bump clicks it one face, a HARD spin (30-60 rad/s, what a turning
//                   robot's corner or a swinging arm leaves it with) still turns it only one face, no
//                   bump in the speed table runs past one face, and two bumps turn it two faces.
//
// Edit-mode simulation never runs MonoBehaviours, so the loop calls the public
// GoalStackMagnet.StepMagnet / RollerSnap.StepDetent between Simulate steps — that is why those
// methods are public and dt-parameterized. The simulation mutates the open scene; it is ALWAYS
// reloaded from disk afterwards so simulated poses are never saved.
//
// Also asserts SCENE = CODE for every RollerSnap: a serialized scene value wins over the C# default,
// and the scene once sat at maxCorrectionPerStep 0.2 while the code said 0.35 — a retune nobody
// could see. Attach or Tune Roller Detents copies the code onto the scene; this fails if it was not run.
//
// Requires the scene fixes to have been applied first (Add Goal Stack Magnets, Attach or Tune Roller
// Detents). Batch: -executeMethod FieldFeatureValidation.RunBatch (throws -> nonzero exit).
