// Validates robot delivery: where a bundle lives, who can find it, and whether this build is allowed
// to open it.
//
// Every failure this guards against is silent from the developer's side, and several are permanent:
//
//   - THE ADDRESS MOVED. A private robot lives at a folder derived from a hash of its owner code.
//     Change how that hash is computed and every robot ever published becomes unreachable — the app
//     asks for a path nothing was ever written to, players see "hasn't been published yet", and no
//     amount of rebuilding fixes it because the old files are at the old address. The hash is
//     therefore PINNED to a literal, exactly as the inbox fingerprint is, so it can only change on
//     purpose.
//
//   - THE SCRIPTS MOVED. A bundle serializes the components on the robot prefab. Add a serialized
//     field to RobotMotorController and Unity deserializes every older bundle against the new
//     layout: the missing field comes back as its default, silently, and the robot drives wrong
//     rather than failing to load. CheckScriptLayout pins the shape of every script that sits on a
//     robot so this is caught here rather than on someone's phone.
//
//   - THE ADDRESS LEAKED. A private robot listed in the public index is not private, however well
//     the download is guarded.
//
//   - THE ROUTE WAS NEVER SWITCHED ON. Every check above can pass while the app is incapable of
//     downloading anything, because the download begins at a RobotUploadConfig reference held by the
//     RobotSpawner in the field scene — and that reference was null in both field scenes for the
//     whole life of the route. CheckSceneWiring is the one check here that opens a scene, because it
//     is the only part of delivery that lives in one.
