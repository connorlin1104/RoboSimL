// laid out around the two existing joysticks, plus the Reset / Home / Camera row at the top center.
//
//   - L1/L2 stacked at the top-left, R1/R2 at the top-right (shoulder/trigger positions)
//   - two four-button diamonds between the joysticks along the bottom center:
//     arrows (Up/Down/Left/Right) on the left, X/B/A/Y on the right (VEX arrangement:
//     X top, B right, A bottom, Y left)
//   - Home (relocated from the top-left corner, which the shoulders now occupy) and a new
//     Reset button that reloads the scene.
//   - a camera button under them that switches between the two views, plus the ChaseCamera
//     object (the robot follow view) those views switch between.
//
// Every button is an OnScreenButton writing a synthetic <Gamepad> control (leftShoulder,
// buttonNorth, dpad/up, ...), the same mechanism the OnScreenSticks already use. The button
// actions live in Assets/RobotControls.inputactions; ButtonRouter routes them to robot mechanisms.
//

// and recreated), so re-running only touches what changed, preserves object identities that
// ControlsAppearance references, and produces a byte-identical scene when nothing changed.
