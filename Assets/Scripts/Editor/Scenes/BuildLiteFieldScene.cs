// Builds Assets/Scenes/LiteScene.unity: the full field pruned down to ONE of every structure it is
// built out of, spread a structure to a quadrant so nothing crowds anything else.
//
// Why prune a copy instead of composing a scene from parts: there are no field prefabs. The whole
// field is inline in SampleScene (imported from OverrideFieldVersion3.fbx and then rigged in place by
// the Field & Pieces tools), so "one cup" can only mean "the cup that is already there, minus the
// other 35". Re-running regenerates from the CURRENT SampleScene, so the lite scene never drifts.
//
// What it's for: SampleScene is ~4,000 GameObjects and ~1,400 renderers, with 45 stack magnets each
// running a Physics.OverlapSphere every fixed step at 100 Hz. The lite field keeps enough to exercise
// every mechanism — drive, match load, roller, intake, scoring against all three sizes of goal — at a
// fraction of the cost, so Play is quick and a physics change is easy to isolate.
//
// What survives, and where. The quadrants are of the playing surface, whose centre is NOT the world
// origin (the floor is centred on z = 5.9), so they are measured off the floor rather than assumed:
//
//     (-X,+Z)  one cup with four pins lying flat around it   (+X,+Z)  an alliance goal (the short one)
//     (-X,-Z)  three cups in a row against the wall with     (+X,-Z)  a neutral goal (the mid stake)
//              one pin standing in the middle cup                     and the roller on the wall
//                                                                     behind it
//     centre   the tall central stake, and one cup with a pin standing in it
//
// Both neutral goals — the tall central stake and the mid one — keep the pin standing in them, the
// way the full field loads them. The alliance goal is bare there too.
//
// and on the perimeter, which is shared ground rather than any one quadrant's: all four walls, all
// four corners, all four white tape lines, and one match loader — the one nearest the spawn, still
// wired to its own tape.
//
// Structures are found by GEOMETRY, not by name: "three cups within a row's span of each other with an
// upright pin in the middle one" survives a re-authored or renamed field, where a name list would
// silently keep nothing. The same is true of the goals, which are told apart by height.
//
// Whole structures are kept, never a piece out of the middle of one. That is not tidiness: the earlier
// version kept a lone pin and deleted the cups it was standing in, and the pin was left 85 mm in the
// air until the settle pass dropped it somewhere else.
//
// SampleScene itself is never written: the prune happens in memory and is saved to a NEW path.
