# Robot submissions

How a player's robot gets from their computer into RoboSim, and what has to be switched on for
the in-game **Settings → Submit a Robot** screen to work.

## Why it's developer-in-the-loop

The app cannot set up a robot by itself, and no amount of work will change that. Three separate parts
of the pipeline are Unity Editor APIs that do not exist in a built player:

- **Importing the model.** Turning an FBX or URDF into Unity meshes is an editor importer.
- **Generating colliders.** The V-HACD convex decomposition runs through
  `Assets/Plugins/Editor/librobosim_vhacd.dylib`, which is Editor-gated and macOS-arm64 only.
- **Saving the result.** `PrefabUtility.SaveAsPrefabAsset` and `AssetDatabase` have no runtime
  equivalent.

On top of that, marking each moving part and assigning roles for a claw or lift is a judgement job.
So the flow is: player uploads → you set it up in the editor → it goes out to them.

**That last step no longer means "in the next app update".** A set-up robot can be published as a
downloadable AssetBundle instead of being compiled into the binary — see
[Robot-Delivery.md](Robot-Delivery.md). Everything above still holds: the setup is Editor-only and
always will be. What changed is only how the finished robot travels.

## Switching submissions on

1. Create a Firebase project. Enabling Storage requires the **Blaze** (pay-as-you-go) plan — Spark
   no longer includes it — so read *What it can cost* below before turning it on.
2. Enable **Authentication → Sign-in method → Anonymous**. The first uid a device is given is kept in
   PlayerPrefs and reused as the folder name for every later submission, so one player's robots stay
   together.
3. Enable **Storage**, then deploy the rules so the app can write submissions and read only the
   inbox:

   ```
   firebase deploy --only storage
   ```

   **`storage.rules` at the repo root is the only copy.** `firebase.json` points the deploy at it and
   `.firebaserc` pins the project, so that file is what is running. Read the rules there; do not
   paste a block out of documentation or out of a source comment. Both used to carry their own
   paraphrase, and a paraphrase that quietly drops the size cap deploys clean, passes every manual
   test, and removes the one limit below that is actually enforced.

   The write rule checks only that the caller signed in, **not** that the folder matches their uid.
   That is deliberate: anonymous sign-up mints a brand-new uid on every call, so a player who
   restored their id on a new device signs in as someone else entirely and would be locked out of
   their own folder. Anyone can obtain an anonymous sign-in, so treat `/uploads` as untrusted input —
   which it is anyway, being arbitrary player files.

   **The size cap is the only limit that is actually enforced.** `maxUploadMegabytes` in the config
   asset is a courtesy check inside the app; the rule is what a request that skips the app runs into.
   Keep the rule at or above the config value — if the rule is the smaller number, honest uploads
   pass the in-app check and then fail with an unexplained 403.

   **Restricting the file type here would not work, and would break your own uploads.** Rules never
   see the bytes, only the name, the declared `Content-Type`, the size, and the token — and the first
   two are chosen by the caller, so junk named `robot.fbx` satisfies any type rule. Meanwhile the
   model goes up as `application/octet-stream` and the sidecar as `<file>.json`, so an fbx/urdf/zip
   allowlist would reject both. For the same reason, don't add `resource == null` to make writes
   create-only: filenames carry no uniquifier, so a player who fixes their CAD and resends
   `robot.fbx` would be refused.

   `{file}` rather than `{file=**}` keeps both folders flat — uploads are always one level under the
   per-player folder, so nobody has a reason to build a deep tree in the bucket. `SanitizeFileName`
   maps every character outside `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` to `_`, including `/`, and the team and robot names
   that make up the rest of the path go through a stricter filter still, so an upload key can never
   gain a second level and reach past the single-segment match.

4. In Unity, fill in `Assets/Settings/RobotUploadConfig.asset`:
   - **Storage Bucket** — from the Storage tab, e.g. `overridesim.firebasestorage.app`
   - **Web API Key** — Project settings → General
   - **Max Upload Megabytes** — currently 200; keep it at or below the cap in `storage.rules`

   The web API key is not a secret. Firebase web keys are public identifiers; access is decided by
   `storage.rules`, not by hiding the key. It ships inside every build and is committed to this
   repo deliberately — see *What it can cost* for what does and doesn't follow from that.

   GitHub secret scanning flags it anyway, because `AIzaSy…` is also the shape of billable Maps and
   Cloud keys. Close those alerts as a false positive rather than rotating: a replacement is equally
   public the moment it ships, and the key is API-restricted to the services this app calls, so it
   cannot reach anything else on the project.

Until the bucket and key are set, the screen still opens and lets a player pick a file, and then says
submitting isn't switched on yet — it never fails halfway through an upload.

Uploads land as `uploads/<when>_<TEAM>_<uploaderId>/<Robot>-<filename>`, with a `<...>.json` sidecar
next to each one holding the team, robot name, contact, notes, **who the uploader wants to be able to
use it**, app version and timestamp. Firebase does not notify you on its own; either check the
Storage tab or add a Cloud Function on finalize to email yourself.

```
uploads/20260802-143205_654V_aB3dEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz12/CLAW-export.fbx
uploads/20260802-143205_654V_aB3dEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz12/CLAW-export.fbx.json
```

**Read it as a queue.** Storage sorts object names as text and has no sort-by-date, so the fixed-width
UTC stamp on the front is what makes "the newest submissions" somewhere you can look instead of
something you have to work out. Sort ascending and new ones arrive at the bottom; descending and they
arrive at the top. The width is fixed and the order of the fields is `yyyyMMdd-HHmmss` precisely so
text order and time order are the same order — `RobotInboxValidation` asserts that across a
single-digit day, a two-digit month and a year rollover, because a listing that claims to be
chronological and isn't is worse than one that never claimed it.

The stamp is the *sending device's* clock, taken from the submission's own `submittedAtUtc` so the
folder name and the sidecar inside it can never disagree. A phone set to next year sorts itself to the
end. The sidecar is the record; the folder name is the index.

The folder used to be the bare uploader id, which is a 28-character random string: a listing of
twenty of them says nothing about whose robot any of them is, so every one had to be opened to find
out. The id stays on the end, because it is what actually groups a player's uploads (a team name is
typed fresh each time and two people can both write "654V"), and because it is the key their inbox is
written under, so you can reply without opening the sidecar. **The id is everything after the LAST
underscore**: the stamp contains none, and the team is upper-cased with every non-alphanumeric
character folded to `-`, so there are exactly two. `<when>_NOTEAM_<id>` is what you get when the team
field was left blank.

What the timestamp costs, so it isn't a surprise: one player's submissions no longer sit together,
and a **resubmission lands beside the original instead of replacing it**. Both are the right trade —
a queue is read newest-first far more often than by-team, and seeing that someone fixed their CAD and
sent it again is worth more than the old copy's space, which the 30-day lifecycle rule reclaims
anyway.

The file carries the robot name because a file called `export.fbx` is a file you have to download to
identify, and a Fusion export is called `export.fbx` more often than anything else. It is also the
name that lands in your Downloads folder on the way into Unity.

Folders from before this change keep their old `<TEAM>_<id>` (or bare-`<id>`) names and sort above
every timestamped one. Nothing migrates and nothing needs to.

Submissions made before this change sit under a bare-id folder. Nothing migrates them and nothing
needs to — the id is still in the name, and the sidecar still says whose it is.

## What it can cost, and capping it

Storage needs the Blaze plan, and Blaze is pay-as-you-go with no automatic ceiling. Since the web API
key is public by design and anonymous sign-in is open to anyone, a person who reads this repo can
write to the bucket without going through the app. That is inherent to the design, not a mistake in
it — but on Blaze it is worth bounding, because there is no plan limit to stop at. Check current
numbers in the console; pricing changes.

What is already in your favour: **the expensive axis is closed.** Egress costs roughly five times
what storage does, and `/uploads` is `allow read: if false`, so nobody can pull anything back out.
Only accumulated storage accrues, at a couple of cents per GB-month, against a free allowance of
several GB. Filling the bucket is slow and cheap to undo; there is no way to run up a large bill fast.

Three controls, in order of how much they buy:

- **A lifecycle rule on the bucket** — `Docs/storage-lifecycle.json`, applied with:

  ```
  gcloud storage buckets update gs://overridesimunity.firebasestorage.app \
      --lifecycle-file=Docs/storage-lifecycle.json
  ```

  or by hand in the Google Cloud console → Cloud Storage → the bucket → **Lifecycle** → *Add a rule*
  → action **Delete object**, condition **Age 30 days** *and* **Name matches prefix** `uploads/`.

  This is the one that matters. Intake is *download the file, set it up, done*, so `/uploads` has no
  reason to retain anything, and the rule makes steady-state cost flat no matter how much arrives.

  **The prefix is not optional.** A lifecycle rule applies to the whole bucket, so an age-only rule
  would also delete `/inbox/<uploaderId>.json` after 30 days — and those must live indefinitely,
  because a player who reinstalls re-reads their inbox to recover the code for a robot that shipped
  months ago. Losing them fails silently: the app treats a missing inbox as "nothing waiting", which
  is exactly what it should do and exactly what makes the breakage invisible.

  Deletion is permanent unless the bucket has object versioning on, which it does not by default.
  Check nothing unprocessed is already older than 30 days before applying it to a bucket that has
  been collecting for a while.
- **A budget alert** in Google Cloud Billing, set low — a few dollars. It emails you within a day or
  two of anything odd, which is all the reaction time this situation needs. Note it only *notifies*;
  the documented hard stop is a budget → Pub/Sub → Cloud Function that detaches the billing account,
  which takes the whole project offline and is more than this is worth.
- **App Check**, before real users. It attests that a request came from your genuine app binary — App
  Attest on iOS, Play Integrity on Android — and rejects everything else before rules even run. It is
  the actual answer to "anyone with the key can call this", and the only one of the three that stops
  the writes rather than bounding their cost. It needs a debug token to keep the Editor working.

## How a player picks a file

Unity has no built-in file picker and no native picker package is installed, so `RobotFilePicker`
uses what already exists:

- **In the editor** — a normal open-file dialog.
- **On device** — the app's own documents folder. The player copies their file in from the Files app
  and it appears in the list; tapping **Choose File** steps through what's there.

For that folder to be visible in the iOS Files app the build needs `UIFileSharingEnabled` and
`LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace` set to `YES` in Info.plist (Xcode, or a post-build script).
If a native picker is added later, `ROBOSIM_NATIVE_FILE_PICKER` is the seam in `RobotFilePicker`.

Accepted: `.fbx`, `.urdf`, `.zip` (a URDF needs its meshes, hence the archive). The screen asks for
an FBX and nothing else — `RobotFilePicker.FormatAdvice` is the whole of what it says.

It used to add "export it from your CAD at Low or Medium refinement", and that came out on
2026-09-09. Refinement is still the sender's only real lever on size (*Why a submission is 100 MB*
below), so the advice was true — it just did not survive contact with the screen it was on. A sender
who knows the setting does not need telling, and a sender who does not is handed a second
instruction, in the same breath as the first, with nowhere in the app to learn what it means. The
sentence that has to land is *send an FBX*. Say the refinement part to a sender directly when a file
comes in too big — by then it is one person, one file, and an answerable question.

**CAD is no longer accepted.** `.step`, `.stp`, `.f3d` and `.f3z` were all on the list until
2026-08-17 and are now refused. *Why a submission is 100 MB* below has the whole trade; the short
version is that nothing in this project can read those formats, so every CAD file bought its size
saving with a manual Fusion round-trip, and decimating the FBX turned out to buy the same reduction
in minutes.

**Size is the real constraint.** The robot FBX files in this project run 100–205 MB. A phone upload
that size takes a while, so the screen shows progress and checks for a connection first.

## Why a submission is 100 MB, and what shrinks it

This is measured, not estimated — a byte census of every array in `Ryan_CascadeRobot.fbx`
(654V v3, 102.9 MB, binary FBX 7200):

| array | on disk | uncompressed | share of file |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Normals** | **42.0 MB** | 212.9 MB | **41%** |
| Vertices (positions) | 21.4 MB | 35.7 MB | 21% |
| UV | 15.5 MB | 34.8 MB | 15% |
| PolygonVertexIndex | 13.1 MB | 35.8 MB | 13% |
| UVIndex | 8.7 MB | 35.8 MB | 8% |
| everything else | 2.2 MB | — | 2% |

Five arrays are 97.8% of the file, and the same ratios hold on all four robots in the project.

Four things follow, and only the last one is actionable:

- **Normals are the biggest single line, at 41%.** They are written `ByPolygonVertex` — one 24-byte
  `float64` normal per *triangle corner*, 9.4 million of them. A flat face repeats the identical
  normal on every corner, which is why it deflates 5.1×; 42 MB survives anyway. Unity re-welds most
  of it on import.
- **A quarter of every upload is UVs, and this project has no textures at all.** `UV` + `UVIndex` are
  24.2 MB of coordinates nothing samples.
- **It is not duplicated geometry.** 3,169 scene objects reference 223 distinct meshes, so the export
  is properly instanced and a repeated screw is stored once. There is nothing to win here.
- **It is tessellation, and it is concentrated.** 1,561,391 positions across 223 parts, but the median
  part is 1,260. **The top 10 parts are 47.6% of all positions**; the biggest is 186,505. On the
  360 RPM Drivetrain it is starker — top 10 of 39 parts is 90.4%.

So the size is set by **corner count**, not part count, and corner count is set by the CAD refinement
setting. A tolerance meant for machining detonates on a plate full of holes and costs nothing on a
simple bracket, which is why a handful of bodies carry half the file.

**What a sender can do**, in order of leverage:

1. **Export at a lower mesh refinement.** In Fusion's FBX export this is the refinement control —
   Low or Medium rather than High. This is the whole ballgame.
2. **Re-tessellate only the worst bodies.** Half the file is 10 bodies out of 223; the other 213 are
   already fine and touching them buys nothing.
3. **Turn off UV export** if the exporter offers it. 24% off, and it costs nothing here.

### Asking for CAD instead, and why that stopped

For about six weeks the pipeline asked for the CAD rather than the mesh, and the argument was a good
one: a `.step` or `.f3d` is a fraction of the size *and* still holds the exact surfaces, so
refinement stays a decision that can be made later instead of one baked in by the sender. Everything
STEP drops, this pipeline discards anyway — joints are rebuilt as ArticulationBodies regardless, and
the plastic-vs-metal gate is name-based (`IsUnderPlastic` in `GeneratePartColliders.cs`), so
component names and hierarchy are all the setup tools read.

**It was dropped on 2026-08-17.** The argument was never wrong; what it left out is who pays. Nothing
here can *read* those formats — Unity imports none of them — so the saving was collected by hand, in
Fusion, on one machine, and driving a whole assembly down to a usable refinement there is slow,
fiddly work. It became the step the pipeline stalled on.

### Decimating instead

Two places to do it, and they are not exclusive:

- **Blender, before the file reaches Unity.** Import, Decimate modifier, export. On the first robot
  through this path it took the file down by more than half in minutes — the same reduction the CAD
  round-trip existed to buy. It also shrinks what `Assets/Models/Submitted/` and the model store have
  to carry.
- **`Tools ▸ RoboSim ▸ Robot ▸ Reduce Robot Meshes`, after import.** Quadric decimation with a
  Hausdorff error reported per mesh, and it lifts the meshes out of the FBX into standalone assets
  as a second win — see [Robot-Delivery.md](Robot-Delivery.md).

Neither recovers a surface, so both are worse *in principle* than tessellating from CAD at the right
density; the failure mode is the one in Robot-Delivery.md's decimation note, holes in VEX metal going
polygonal. What settled it is that the error is measured at the ratio actually used, and it is small,
where the Fusion round-trip's cost was real every single time.

**So what to tell a sender is one line: export at Low or Medium.** It is one dropdown in every CAD
package, and everything past it is handled on this side. Say it *to them*, though — it is no longer
on the submit screen, for the reason in *How a player picks a file* above.

## Setting up a submission when it arrives

The whole path for one submission, in order. Background lives elsewhere: `Fusion360-URDF-Export.md`
§A for the FBX export settings, [Robot-Delivery.md](Robot-Delivery.md) for bundles, and
[Model-Storage.md](Model-Storage.md) for the model store.

1. Download the file and its `.json` sidecar from the Storage bucket.
   - The sidecar's `sharing` field decides **Listed For** in step 6.
2. Decimate it if it is over ~50 MB — see *Decimating instead* above.
   - Keep the file you decimated from, outside the project. A re-decimation can only start from it,
     and nothing upstream can regenerate it now that CAD is refused.
3. Copy the `.fbx` into `Assets/Models/Submitted/` — the `.fbx` only, never a `.fbx.meta`.
   - Stow only takes models from that folder, and git ignores it, so nothing there reaches LFS.
4. Drag it into SampleScene, right-click the instance ▸ `Prefab ▸ Unpack Completely`, select the
   root, and run `Tools ▸ RoboSim ▸ Robot ▸ Set Up Imported Robot`.
   - Unpack first, every time: rigging reparents the wheels, which a prefab instance can't record,
     and Set Up Imported Robot doesn't warn you.
   - Expect "Detected: mesh/FBX robot."
   - Set **Wheel Name Contains** to a token in the wheel nodes' names; comma-separate several.
   - Leave **Save As Prefab After** on. One click gives colliders, motorized wheels, the catalog
     entry, `Assets/Robots/<Name>.prefab` and a physics smoke test, then removes the scene copy and
     saves the scene.
   - Lying on its side? Tick **Bake Axis Conversion** on the FBX (Model tab), or rotate the root —
     the spawner keeps an authored orientation.
5. Add the mechanisms, if it has any: open the prefab (the builders that reparent need Prefab
   Mode), then `Tools ▸ RoboSim ▸ Robot ▸ Mechanisms ▸ …`.
6. `Tools ▸ RoboSim ▸ Robot ▸ Save As Robot Prefab`, and set **Listed For** per the sidecar's
   `sharing` field — **Public** for "Anyone", **Private** with an owner code otherwise.
7. Set up the home-stage chips — the row under the robot's name on the home screen
   (**44 W Drive**, **22 W Cascade**, **Claw**):
   - Run `Tools ▸ RoboSim ▸ Scenes ▸ Build Home Screen`. It reads the lift (Cascade / DR4B), a
     Floating Intake and a Claw off the saved rig.
   - Open `Tools ▸ RoboSim ▸ Robot ▸ Model Catalog`, pick the robot, find **Home stage chips**.
   - Type **Drivetrain watts** and the lift's watts (11 per 11 W motor, 5.5 per 5.5 W motor).
     - The line under them is the CAD's motor total, not the split: ask the team which motors
       drive what.
   - Fix a wrong label with its popup: **Always** or **Never**. **Clamp** shows only on
     **Always** — nothing detects a clamp yet.
   - Check the preview line at the top, and clear any yellow warning.
   - Change them after publishing and step 8 needs redoing: a Storage robot's chips travel in its
     index.
8. Build and publish its bundle: `Tools ▸ RoboSim ▸ Robot ▸ Build Robot Bundle`.
   - Pick the robot first. The window opens on the first catalog entry, the 360 RPM Drivetrain,
     and Remove From Binary on that one takes the free robot out of the app.
   - Have **Serve From Storage** and **Remove From Binary** on, and iOS and Android ticked (the
     defaults). A greyed-out platform means its build module isn't installed.
   - Upload `robots/` as the report says ([Robot-Delivery.md](Robot-Delivery.md) step 3), then
     probe the download URL. A 403 is the storage rules, not the upload.
9. Play, spawn it and drive it — this is the robot as players will get it.
10. Tell the player it's ready, by writing their inbox file (below).
11. Reclaim the disk, whenever: `Tools ▸ RoboSim ▸ Robot ▸ Model Store` → **Stow**.
    - Check SampleScene has no robot instance first; delete it and save if one crept back in. A
      model a scene references can never be stowed.
    - Pre-flight: `Tools ▸ RoboSim ▸ Robot ▸ Advanced ▸ Check Model Store Round-Trip`. A failure
      there is the tool, not the robot — stop.
    - A refusal names its cause:
      - "still has a direct prefab reference in the catalog": Remove From Binary was off.
      - "referenced by 2 files" / "is a scene, not a prefab": the SampleScene check above.
      - "only N of them resolve": the robot was broken before you stowed it.
    - Play and spawn it again with the FBX gone. It must look and drive exactly as in step 9.
    - To rebuild it later: Model Store → **Fetch**. Expect `N/N resolved` and
      `finger <hash> (matches)`.

- **Starting a robot over:** `Tools ▸ RoboSim ▸ Robot ▸ Delete Robot`. Never delete just the
  prefab: the catalog entry survives, the spawner falls back to the old bundle, and the previous
  version spawns — which looks exactly like the editor caching something.
- **Never delete a submitted FBX; stow it.** Rebuilding after any change to the setup tools starts
  from that file. The store lives on one Mac, so back it up.

**When it doesn't work, say so.** Some submissions can't be made to drive: the export is one welded
lump with nothing to pivot, the file is a render mesh with no separable components, half the assembly
is missing, the archive has a URDF and no meshes. These are ordinary outcomes and the player is the
only person who can fix any of them — so the same inbox carries a message instead of a code (below).
Silence is the one reply that can't be recovered from: it is indistinguishable from never having
looked, and the player has no way to tell which it was.

## Telling a player what happened

Whichever way the robot travels — compiled into a new app version, or published as a bundle it can
download ([Robot-Delivery.md](Robot-Delivery.md)) — the app still has to *say* it arrived and enter
the code, or explain why it isn't coming. Otherwise the only reply channel is the free-text contact
field, and a typo there orphans a submission for good.

Upload a file to `inbox/<uploaderId>.json` in the same bucket, where `<uploaderId>` is the folder name
their submission arrived under. One file, two kinds of item:

```json
{ "items": [
    { "robotName": "654V Claw", "code": "654V-8213", "message": "" },
    { "id": "lift-2026-08", "robotName": "654V Lift",
      "message": "The arm came in as one solid piece, so nothing can pivot. Re-export with the arm as its own component and send it again." }
] }
```

An item **with a code is an arrival**: the home screen shows *"654V Claw is ready"* with a button that
enters the code. Write it when the version carrying the robot goes out — though writing it early is
harmless, because an item is ignored while no robot in the installed build uses its code, and the
notice simply appears once the update lands. It is also ignored once the code is held, which is what
stops it repeating.

An item with **only a message is a note**: the same banner, the message in full, and a *Got it*
button. Use it for a robot that couldn't be set up, and for an aside next to one that could ("the
intake is simplified — the CAD had it as one piece"), which shows under the arrival line.

A note has no code, so nothing about the device changes when it's read and it can't filter itself out
the way an arrival does. It is remembered instead: by its `id` when it has one, and otherwise by a
fingerprint of its own text. Two consequences worth knowing —

- **Rewriting a note shows it again.** Correct a message and the player sees the correction. That is
  the behaviour you want, and it is why `id` is optional.
- **Give a note an `id` when you want the opposite** — to reword something already read without
  putting it back on their screen. The id is the key, so the text can change under it freely.

Leave old items in the file. Every one of them is filtered on the device, and the file is also what a
player re-reads after a reinstall.

**When an arrival doesn't appear, it is one of exactly two things**, and neither says anything on
screen — `OnInboxFetched` drops the item and the dialog opens without it, or doesn't open at all.
Either would otherwise be a notice that promises a robot and delivers nothing, so the silence is
deliberate; it just means the diagnosis is yours to make.

- **No robot in the installed build uses that code.** Test codes are the usual cause: the catalog is
  compiled in, so a code you invent for a test matches nothing until a build carrying it lands. Check
  `RobotModelCatalog.asset` for an entry that is `visibility: Private` *and* names the code.
- **The code is already held on that device.** Settings → Account lists them, and **Forget Codes**
  clears them. The give-away is the robot already sitting in the picker's Private column.

A note has neither test, which makes it the useful control: if the note shows and the arrival beside
it does not, the fetch, the JSON and the dialog are all fine and the code is the problem.

The uploader id is the only thing guarding an inbox (the rules above make `/inbox` publicly
readable). It is minted on the first submission and lives only in that device's PlayerPrefs, so a
reinstall loses it — and that is now allowed to happen. There used to be a **Settings → Your ID**
section where a player could copy the id and paste it back on a new phone; it was an account system
standing in for nothing anyone needed. What a player actually carries across a reinstall is the owner
**code** their finished robot came back as, and **Settings → Account** lists every code they hold
alongside what it unlocks, so they can re-enter or pass one on.

The practical consequence for you: an inbox notice is a one-shot. If the player reinstalls before
seeing it, re-send them the code by email instead — and for the same reason, a message about a robot
that couldn't be set up is worth sending by email as well as by inbox, since it is the one reply the
player has to act on.

## Team codes

An entry's **Owner Code(s)** field takes a comma-separated list, and holding *any* one of them
reveals the robot. Two consequences worth using:

- Give five of a team's robots the same `654V-TEAM` code and one code unlocks all five.
- Give a robot both its own one-off code and its team's — `CLAW-9F2K, 654V-TEAM` — and either works,
  so an individual robot can be shared without handing over the team's whole set.

Nothing verifies team membership, and nothing can: a self-declared team number is unfalsifiable.
Treat a code as a **capability**, not an identity claim — access starts with whoever sent the robot
in and spreads only because they passed the code on. That makes lying about your team pointless
rather than dangerous. The residual risk is a code leaking, which is the same risk as a teammate
screenshotting the robot, and no software prevents it.

## What "private" does and doesn't mean

It depends on how the robot travels, and the difference is real.

**Compiled into the app** (every robot today): the geometry is on every device that installs the
build, and *private* means only that the picker, the controller config screen and the spawner filter
it out until its owner enters the code. That stops one player casually copying another's design. It
does **not** stop someone extracting the model from the app's files.

**Published as a bundle** ([Robot-Delivery.md](Robot-Delivery.md)): the robot lives at an address
derived from a hash of its owner code, so the geometry never reaches a device that hasn't been given
the code. Not covered: someone holding both the app files and the code — once a device can fetch a
robot it can keep it, which was always true.

Note that the two are not equally private but they *are* equally revocable, which is to say not at
all: a code that has been handed out cannot be taken back, and republishing under a new code orphans
the old address rather than closing it.
