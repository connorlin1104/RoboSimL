# RoboSimL

Drive the robot before you build it. Send your team's 3D model and get it back as a machine you can
actually drive — real joints, real weight, real drivetrain.

A competition-robotics simulator for iPhone and iPad, built in Unity. Robots are driven with twin
on-screen sticks and a twelve-button controller, on a field of physics pieces that can be picked up,
carried and scored.

- **App Store:** RoboSimL 1.0, submitted 2026-09-09
- **Support page:** <https://overridesimunity.web.app/>
- **The project began as *OverrideSim*.** The app, and now this repository, are RoboSimL. The
  Firebase project id (`overridesimunity`) and some internal folder paths still carry the old name,
  because renaming those would break every reference to them for no user-visible gain

## Requirements

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Unity | **6000.5.0f1** — the exact version in `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` |
| Target | iOS 15.0+, iPhone and iPad, **landscape only** |
| Git LFS | **required before cloning** — see below |

### Cloning

`.fbx`, `.dylib` and the generated meshes under `Assets/RobotMeshes/` are stored in Git LFS. Clone
without it and you get text pointer files where the robots should be, and Unity imports nothing.

```
git lfs install
git clone git@github.com:connorlin1104/RoboSimL.git
```

Already cloned without LFS? `git lfs install && git lfs pull`.

## Layout

| Path | What's in it |
| --- | --- |
| `Assets/Scripts/Drivetrain/` | Wheel torque, the turn/drive authority mix, the tyre friction model |
| `Assets/Scripts/Mechanisms/` | Lifts, intakes, pistons — the actuators a robot is built from |
| `Assets/Scripts/Robot/` | Robot assembly, the mechanism registry, control routing |
| `Assets/Scripts/FieldPieces/` | Scoreable pieces, goals, the field's latching rollers |
| `Assets/Scripts/Services/` | Robot upload, catalog sync, bundle delivery — the Firebase side |
| `Assets/Scripts/UI/` | Home screen, settings, the driving controls |
| `Assets/Scripts/Editor/` | The build tooling — over half the code. Rig builders, collider generation, mesh decimation, screenshot capture, validation rigs |
| `Assets/Robots/` | The four robots that ship, as prefabs |
| `Docs/` | Real procedure docs, not notes — see below |
| `Web/` | The support and privacy pages, deployed to Firebase Hosting |
| `storage.rules` | Firebase Storage rules — what actually guards uploads |

### Scenes

- **`HomeScene`** — entry point, index 0. Model picker, settings, Submit a Robot
- **`SampleScene`** — the full competition field
- **`LiteScene`** — a reduced field for lower-end devices

### Robots that ship

`360 RPM Drivetrain`, `654V v1`, `654V v2`, `654V v3`. All four are the author's own team's designs,
published with permission.

## Docs

Written to be followed, not skimmed. Each one exists because something in it was non-obvious enough
to cost real time.

| Doc | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| `Docs/App-Store-Submission.md` | Every App Store Connect field and the reasoning behind each answer |
| `Docs/TestFlight-Build.md` | Unity → Xcode → TestFlight, and the traps in that path |
| `Docs/Device-Performance.md` | Measuring the app on the phone: the performance readout and the test runs |
| `Docs/Robot-Submissions.md` | What happens when a player sends a robot in, and setting one up step by step |
| `Docs/Robot-Delivery.md` | Decimating, bundling and addressing a finished robot back to its team |
| `Docs/Model-Storage.md` | Where models live and why a prefab cannot outlive its FBX |
| `Docs/Fusion360-URDF-Export.md` | Getting a CAD assembly out as something the importer reads |
